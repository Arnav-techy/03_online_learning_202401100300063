With the rapid growth of online education, student retention has become a significant challenge. A large portion of learners start but do not finish online courses. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a learner will complete an online course based on their activity logs.
By identifying key behavioral patterns from interaction data, institutions can intervene early and improve student success rates.


Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method used for classification and regression tasks. It builds multiple decision trees during training time and merges their results (votes) to improve accuracy and avoid overfitting.
